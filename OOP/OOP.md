# Topic Questions for Object Oriented Programming

1. Why have classes in the first place?
2. What value does encapulsation provide?
3. When is polymorphism useful? What does it help us to describe?
4. Why might you want to use abstraction?
5. When should you not use inheritance?
6. What is SOLID? And why is it important?

## Notes

Covarience and contravariance 
Class is a construct by grouping together variables of other types, methods, and events. Definites a date and behavior of a type.
Hermetically Sealed 
Dynamic polymorphism and static polymorphism
Assembly is like an executable or library
Entrypoint / ildasm for disassembly 
Autoproperties
